## technology used 
This trivia game based on the dark souls videogame series was built using html css and javscript all questions and answers were custom built in javascript and all the images were imported through javascript as well.

## design
the clickable answer options were built using flex and the overlay and all movement were acheived through transitions and two seperate webkit animations
the score is kept based on click event on the right answer and the counter is then inputed to the answers variables in order to have the questions and pictures change after correctly answering.

## issues
the incorrect answer curently uses an alert to display but in the future it would display a pop up text overlay indicating a wrong answer
